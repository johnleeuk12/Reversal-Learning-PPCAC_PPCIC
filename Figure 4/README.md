# Example data
Ca_data_example.mat is an example of the calcium imaging recording data of one cell as well as relevant behavioral information such as detected lick times and trial outcome during task. \
This is the data used for all analyses using calcium imaging data.

eg_Data{n,1} = recorded dF/F0 (in sample number)\
eg_Data{n,2} = Lick times (s)\
eg_Data{n,3} = Behavior data (see below)
- 1st column : stim onset time (in sample number)
- 2nd column : rule (1 or 2)
- 3rd to 7th column : Go, Lick, Reward, Correct, stim

eg_Data{n,4} = time corresponding to each sample (in s) \
eg_Data{n,5} = Trial to reversal\
eg_Data{n,6} = recorded session id\
eg_Data{n,7} = rewarded time (0 if no reward)
